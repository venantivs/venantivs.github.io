### About me

Salvete! My name is JosÃ© VenÃ¢ncio. I'm a software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· currently working with Ruby on Rails.

My interests, aside from programming, ranges from electronics, goes through cars (passion since childhood) till pretty much every branch of post-classical to early modern history (architecture, music, languages, politics, _et cetera_). But don't worry, I'll keep it technical and factual here, and if any opinions are going to be made, they'll be purely analytical and based on evidence.

Also, I'm fascinated with ecclesiastical Latin ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡¦, but I know very little about it given it is a dead language, but I'm trying to improve.

### My experience

Even though my "professional" experience started around 2018, I began tinkering with programming circa 2012 when I fell in love with a random WINAPI DLL C++ code, which was probably a game hack or something I found in a hacking forum. Since then I joined a professional school during high school and started a Computer Science degree at the Federal University of SÃ£o JoÃ£o del-Rei in 2017, completing it in 2021.

#### 2018 - 2019

Worked as an intern at the Federal University of SÃ£o JoÃ£o del-Rei (UFSJ) in the International Relations department (ASSIN) creating a whole web application based on PHP and MySQL from the ground up with 2 main parts: A website available to everyone to access and a dashboard to manage that said website.

#### 2021 - Current

Working at [Reev](https://reev.co/), developing a b2b sales web platform using Rails, VueJS, Postgres and many AWS technologies, such as Lambdas (with Python), S3, ECS (Fargate), and so on.
