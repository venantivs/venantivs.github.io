## About me

Salvete! My name is JosÃ© VenÃ¢ncio. I'm a software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· currently working with Ruby on Rails.

My interests, aside from programming, ranges from electronics, goes through cars (passion since childhood) till pretty much every branch of post-classical to early modern history (architecture, music, languages, politics, _et cetera_). But don't worry, I'll keep it technical here, and if any opinions are going to be made, they'll be purely analytical and based on evidence, like Ruby > Python, for example.
